# Snake Redux
Classic snake game with additional features. Created in Python using the Turtle package.

Speed of the snake increases with every point scored, two new type of food appear.
Red food destroys up to six blocks from the snakes tail but increases speed dramatically.
Yellow food increases the snakes tail by ten blocks but reduces speed somewhat.

Highscores are saved to a text file.
